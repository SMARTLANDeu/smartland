<li><strong><em>What is the required level of knowledge and technologies in order to use Smartland development platform ?</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you decide to contribute to the project, the best would be to get familiar with the environment, frameworks and dependencies, we are using in the project. </p>
<p>The <strong>SmartLand</strong> project works on the top of the Geoserver, which serves the geo-data in the cached-tiled form. From the front-end side, most significant dependency is Leaflet. Leaflet is open-source javascript library, which handles geospatial operations. </p>
