<h3 id="smartland-slovak-cadastral-data">SmartLand &amp; Slovak cadastral data</h3>
<p>In this use-case, we have connected data from <em>Urban Atlas</em> with the <em>Slovak cadastral data</em>. In order to get the Slovak Cadastral data to our application, we had to use public API for Slovak cadastre, which is provided by GKU. With this, on every click, you can get the information about the owners of every single piece of land. </p>
<p>This can bring the huge added value for urban gardeners, who are eager to set up new urban gardens in the city. With this application, they now know, who is the owner of the land, they are interested in and they can directly contact them.     </p>
<h3 id="smartland-cz-cadastre">SmartLand &amp; CZ Cadastre</h3>
<p>This use-case is very similar as previous one, but we used data of <em>Czech cadastre</em>. To do so, we used service of <em>CUZK</em> called <em>Nahlížení do KN</em>, which provides cadastral data. Comparing to the previous example, the functionality is a bit different. After every click, the URL link is generated and you can get the cadastral information after clicking on this link. </p>
