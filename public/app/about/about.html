<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p><em>SmartLand</em> is web-application, which helps people to find <strong><em>vacant</em></strong> and <strong><em>unused land</em></strong> in their cities. <em>SmartLand</em> users can be food growers, city farmers and each person who is interested in the <strong><em>urban gardens</em></strong> and gardening in the cities. This application is bringing huge added value in the field of urban gardening of the cities of Danube region.      </p>
<h3 id="smartland-data">SmartLand Data</h3>
<p><em>SmartLand</em> web-application consists of several geo-spatial datasets and technologies. For our services, we are using datasets:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Urban Atlas</em></strong> (<a href="http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/urban-atlas">http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/urban-atlas</a>) - Part of the local component of the GMES/Copernicus land monitoring services. It provides reliable, inter-comparable, high-resolution land use maps for 305 Large Urban Zones and their surroundings (more than 100.000 inhabitants as defined by the Urban Audit) for the reference year 2006.</li>
<li><strong><em>Corine Land Cover</em></strong> (<a href="http://land.copernicus.eu/">http://land.copernicus.eu/</a>) - Dataset consists of the inventory of 44 classes of land cover. </li>
<li><strong><em>Mapbox Basemap</em></strong> (<a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">https://www.mapbox.com/</a>) - Used as a baselayer.    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="smartland-team">SmartLand Team</h3>
<p><em>SmartLand</em> was created and developed by a non-formal group of young coders and web developers and one devoted urban grower, who wanted to ease the process of food growing in urban areas. The first prototype was developed during <em>DanubeHack 2015</em> where the group had first met. The development of the actual SmartLand application was subsequently funded by <strong><em>European Commission Joint Research Center (JRC)</em></strong> within the <strong><em>Danube Reference Data and Services (DRDSI)</em></strong> project.    </p>
<h3 id="smartland-users">SmartLand Users</h3>
<p>Potential users of the Smartland can be divided into two groups in general.    </p>
<ul>
<li>The first group is <strong><em>users</em></strong>, who want to use Smartland as a tool, which can help the in getting to the unused land. </li>
<li>The second group is <strong><em>developers</em></strong>, who are willing to build the extensions of the Smartland application or build application on the top of Smartland core. For those, the source code is in GitHub repository (<a href="https://github.com/SMARTLANDeu/smartland.git">https://github.com/SMARTLANDeu/smartland.git</a>). The application is open-source, so they are welcome to use it. </li>
